MULTIDIMENSIONAL TASK - COLOR SHOP
The project is my improvisation and covers work with multidimensional arrays and 
I aimed to exercise them. The task is to replace the last element taken from each 
array and to replace it with the color desired by the client and finally to display the whole matrix.
